      <div className="lead">
        useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed
        for rendering.
      </div>
      <h2>Reference</h2>
      <p>Call useRef at the top level of your component to declare a ref.</p>
      <div>
        <h3>Parameters</h3>
        <p>
          initialValue: The value you want the ref objectâ€™s current property to
          be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored
          after the initial render.
        </p>
        <h3>Returns</h3>
        <p>useRef returns an object with a single property:</p>
        <p>
          current: Initially, itâ€™s set to the initialValue you have passed. You
          can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to
          React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current
          property. On the next renders, useRef will return the same object.
        </p>
        <h3>Caveats</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can mutate the ref.current property. Unlike state, it is
            mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering
            (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldnâ€™t mutate that
            object.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you change the ref.current property, React does not re-render
            your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a
            ref is a plain JavaScript object.
          </li>

          <li>
            Do not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for
            initialization. This makes your componentâ€™s behavior unpredictable.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Strict Mode, React will call your component function twice in
            order to help you find accidental impurities. This is
            development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref
            object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be
            discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be),
            this should not affect the behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>
          useRef <b>returns a ref object with a single current property </b>
          initially set to the initial value you provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the next renders, useRef will return the same object. You can
          change its current property to store information and read it later.
          This might remind you of state, but there is an important difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render.</b> This means refs
          are perfect for storing information that doesnâ€™t affect the visual
          output of your component. So refs are not appropriate for storing
          information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that
          instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it
          later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref,
          you need to manually change its current property. Later, you can read
          that interval ID from the ref so that you can call clear that interval
        </p>
        <p>By using a ref, you ensure that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You can <b>store information</b> between re-renders (unlike regular
            variables, which reset on every render).
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing it <b>does not trigger a re-render</b> (unlike state
            variables, which trigger a re-render).
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>information is local</b> to each copy of your component
            (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
